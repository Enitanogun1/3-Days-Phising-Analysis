# 3-Days-Phising-Analysis

Welcome to my 3-Days-Phishing-Analysis project! 

ðŸš¨
I created this repository as a hands-on, step-by-step learning lab to document and share my journey into phishing email analysis. Over three days, Iâ€™ll walk through practical techniques, tools, and workflows I used to detect, investigate, and extract Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) from phishing campaigns.

What this project covers

Breaking down phishing emails by analyzing headers, body content, URLs, and attachments

Exploring different phishing types and attacker techniques

Applying open-source tools for email forensics and IOC extraction

Developing an investigation mindset for real-world cybersecurity incidents

This project reflects both my learning process and a structured guide for anyone interested in email forensics. Whether youâ€™re just starting out or looking to sharpen your skills, these exercises provide a practical foundation for phishing analysis.

This project is as a result of my practical knowledge from HaxCamp by @ rajneesh
